## Dataset:
The dataset used for analysis and for this repository is from the CORGIS Datasets Project, by Austin Cory Bart, Ryan Whitcomb, Jason Riddle, Omar Saleem, Dr. Eli Tilevich, Dr. Clifford A. Shaffer, and Dr. Dennis Kafura:

Bart, A. et al. CORGIS: The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets. https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/.

The dataset specifically is specifically by Dennis Kafura:

Kafura, D. (2019). Hospitals CSV File. https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/hospitals/.

The dataset contains information of hospitals from all around the Untited States that have designated ratings on categories such as readmission, procedure cost, etc. It contains the following keys for many Medicare-qualified hospitals in the US and was released to the public to enable consumers to make informed decisions about where to seek healthcare:

- Facility Name
- Facility City
- Facility State
- Facility Type
- Rating: Overall
- Rating: Mortality
- Rating: Safety
- Rating: Readmission
- Rating: Experience
- Rating: Effectiveness
- Rating: Timeliness
- Rating: Imaging
- Procedure Cost: Heart Attack
- Procedure Quality: Heart Attack
- Procedure Value: Heart Attack
- Procedure Cost: Heart Failure
- Procedure Quality: Heart Failure
- Procedure Value: Heart Failure
- Procedure Cost: Pneumonia
- Procedure Quality: Pneumonia
- Procedure Value: Pneumonia
- Procedure Cost: Hip-Knee
- Procedure Quality: Hip-Knee
- Procedure Value: Hip-Knee

## Question
The primary question we decided to explore is how does UCSF compare to other medical centers in SF in terms of overall ratings and the cost of certain procedures? We also decided to answer one other question: 1) Do the ratings of hospitals in CA differ depending on the type of facility, like church, government, proprietary, etc.? 

## References
We primarily referenced the R Graph Gallery by Yan Holtz for formatting the visualization of the data:

Holtz, Y. (2018). The R Graph Gallery. https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html.

Additionally, we referenced old work from our previous statistics classes that focused on data visualization and analysis in R.
