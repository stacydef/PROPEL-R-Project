# PROPEL-R-Project
# Dataset: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/. This dataset contains information of hospitals from all around the Untited States that have designated ratings on categories such as readmission, procedure cost, etc. 
# The primary question we decided to explore is how does UCSF compare to other medical centers in SF in terms of overall ratings and the cost of certain procedures? We also decided to answer one other question: 1) Do the ratings of hospitals in CA differ depending on the type of facility, like church, government, proprietary, etc.?
